# CO2BLOCK: A tool for estimating storage resource capacity in saline aquifers

CO2BLOCK provides the automatic estimate of the storage capacity of an aquifer, based on the geomechanical limits to pressure build-up. 

Users only need to open and modify the script "CO2BLOCK.m". There is no need to open or modify the other scripts, which is instead not recommended.

Please refer to the user guide for more detailed instructions. 
If you want to learn more about the theory behind CO2BLOCK, please refer to the following papers:

# CO2BLOCKSEISM
CO2BLOCKSEISM extends CO2BLOCK in screening regional storage resources constrained by injection-induced seismicity. This extension primarily involves:
- calculation of the spatial and temporal evolution of fault slip potential,
- estimating potential magnitude and frequency of seismic events as key parameters controlling seismicity risk and hazard, and
- using a probabilistic framework to address uncertainties in subsurface geomechanical attributes.
