Two formats have been used.

Basic format (assigned cumulative storage volume and 2050 rate):
model type + 
target cumulative injection volume (Gt) + 
target injection rate at 2050`+
duration of the model

example: Gompertz_model_Cum78Gt_75Mty_400y

Peak format (assigned peak rate and 2050 format- cum vol is calculated):
model type + 
calculated cumulative injection volume (Gt) +
target peak injection rate + 
target injection rate at 2050`+
duration of the model

example: Growthrate_model_Cum66Gt_peak1100Mty_75Mty_170y
